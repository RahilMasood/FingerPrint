# Fingerprint Blood Group Classification using Deep Learning  

## Overview  
This project implements a **deep learning-based image classification model** to classify blood groups from fingerprint images. It uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a dataset of fingerprint images categorized by blood group.  

## Dataset  
- The dataset is stored in `dataset_blood_group/`, with subdirectories for each blood group.  
- Images are preprocessed using **ImageDataGenerator** (rescaling and validation split).  

## Model Architecture  
The model is a **Deep CNN** with:  
- **4 Convolutional Layers** (ReLU activation, MaxPooling)  
- **Flatten & Dense Layers**  
- **Dropout (0.5) to prevent overfitting**  
- **Softmax Output Layer** for multi-class classification  

## Future Improvements
- Creating a frontend for this.
- Increase dataset size for better generalization.
